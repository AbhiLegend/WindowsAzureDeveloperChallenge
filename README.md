WindowsAzureDeveloperChallenge
==============================
This has been my effort at Windows Azure Developer Challenge..
UPDATING THE CODE FROM MY 3RD CHALLENGE:-SQL AZURE

This solution adds the VS 2012 Cloud project to my SQL Azure Account(As it requires access to the SQL AZURE the solution will not build untill you get hooked to database).

Its shows how we can use grid view with SQl Datasource in addition with ASP.NET to show an example.

The solution also contains backup file as well as the queries..


Added the Azure Website for the Challenge.The website was built in webmatrix 3 and the whole file has been added.
